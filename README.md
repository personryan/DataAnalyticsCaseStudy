# Google Case Study: Cyclistic
> Capstone Case Study for Google Data Analytics Course

## Introduction
Over the course of a few months, I have learnt a lot from the Google Data Analytics Course. There will be 6 sections for each phase of data analysis where I will be applying what I have learnt from the course. This would include the usage of Tableau, R, SQL, Excel Sheets. In the last phase, I would be giving my recommendations based on my analysis.

## Scenario
Before diving into the business task, I would like to provide the scenario of the case study. Cyclistics is a bike-share company in Chicago whereby I am part of the data analytics team. The director of marketing believes that annual memberships are the way to grow the company. Hence, we are tasked to understand how casual and annual members differ in their usage of Cyclistic bikes. These insights would help design a new marketing strategy that focuses on converting casual riders to annual members.
